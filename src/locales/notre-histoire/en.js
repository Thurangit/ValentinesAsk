You're the one who makes my heart beat a little faster every morning. This isn't just a line — it's the truth of every day.

"Under your gaze time stands still,
And the world is nothing but a celebration.
A smile, a hand held out,
And my life is transformed."

I didn't know, before you, how much one person could brighten the grey days. Thank you for being that light. Yours, forever.`,

                `My dear {{name}},

I'm writing you this letter the way you write the story you want to live. With you, every chapter is more beautiful than the last.

"I love you the way we love roses,
Without counting the thorns or the rest.
I love you for the spring you carry,
And for the gentle words you bring me."

You're my muse, my partner in crime, and my most beautiful dream come true. Thank you for existing. I love you.`,

                `{{name}},

If I had to sum up what you mean to me, I wouldn't find the words. So I'll let a little poem speak for me:

"When you pass by, the hours dance,
The sky is dressed in tenderness.
You are the most beautiful romance,
You are my heart, you are my happiness."

Our story has only just begun, and I want to write every line of it by your side. See you soon.`,

                `To you, {{name}},

Some people change a life. You changed mine. Not with grand gestures — with your presence, your laugh, your way of seeing the world.

"You taught me to believe in miracles,
To see stars in the sky.
With you everything is possible,
You are my love, you are my faithful one."

Thank you for being here. Thank you for being you. I love you.`,

                `{{name}}, my love,

This letter is a promise: to love you a little more each day, to choose you again and again.

"I choose you today, tomorrow, always,
The way we choose the sun after rainy days.
You are my sweetness, you are my refuge,
And I want to build my whole life with you."

You're the person I want to write the rest with. The two of us.`,

                `My beautiful {{name}},

You're the kind of person who makes others better. You give without counting, you love without conditions.

"Your smile is a garden,
Where I could lose myself forever.
Every word you say wraps around me,
You are my joy, you are my hope."

Thank you for every moment we've shared. Our story is the one I've always wanted to read. I love you.`,

                `{{name}},

They say love is a journey. With you, every step is a gift.

"We walk side by side along the path,
And the path suddenly becomes more beautiful.
You are the hand I hold,
You are the voice that makes me believe."

Thank you for being the heroine of this adventure. It's only just beginning. Yours, forever.`,

                `To {{name}}, with all my heart,

I don't need big words to tell you what you mean. Sometimes a little verse is enough:

"You are the melody of my mornings,
The sweetness of my evenings, my finest destiny.
With you the world has colours,
You are my love, you are my happiness."

Thank you for being by my side. I love you.`,
